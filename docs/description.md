# VaultPay

VaultPay is a decentralized subscription platform built on the Solana blockchain that leverages auto-compounding vaults to maximize yield for users while handling subscription payments seamlessly.

## Key Features

### Auto-Compounding Vaults

- When a user signs up, they create a vault where they can deposit stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, and PYUSD.
- These vaults are automatically deployed to a yield platform (such as Kamino in Solana) to earn interest. PYUSD, in particular, benefits from higher yields (~20% APR) due to PayPal's support incentives.
- Funds in the vaults are continuously compounded, meaning users earn maximum returns without needing to manage their deposits manually.

### Subscription Payment System

- Users can subscribe to vendors (both traditional and crypto-native) by setting up subscription parameters like the amount, duration, and frequency (e.g., up to 3 months, $50 per month).
- The funds are automatically withdrawn from the auto-compounded vault when the subscription payment is due. This ensures that the user's funds continue to compound and grow until payment time, optimizing the overall return on their deposits.
- The platform simplifies the process by automating the payment and compounding, akin to a "kayıtlı otomatik ödeme" (automatic payment order) in traditional Turkish banking.

### Vendor System

- Vendors (such as streaming services, software subscriptions, or crypto-native services like Helius for Solana RPCs) sign up on VaultPay, providing their wallet and business details. They may also go through a whitelisting process for verification.
- Once registered, vendors can claim subscription payments from users when they are due.
- VaultPay ensures that only legitimate vendors receive payments, adding an extra layer of security for users.

### Yield Distribution

- A small percentage of the yield generated from the user's vaults is allocated to the VaultPay treasury. This helps sustain the platform while allowing users to benefit from the majority of the compounding yield.

## Target Audience

- Crypto-savvy individuals who want to manage subscriptions while optimizing stablecoin yields.
- Vendors and service providers, both traditional and crypto-native, who seek a reliable and automatic payment solution using decentralized finance (DeFi).

## Benefits

- **Users**: Maximize returns on their stablecoin holdings through auto-compounding, while effortlessly paying for subscriptions.
- **Vendors**: Receive guaranteed subscription payments automatically, without administrative hassle.
- **DeFi Integration**: Taps into the high yields available in decentralized finance on Solana, specifically leveraging high-performance smart contracts through Anchor.

VaultPay bridges the gap between subscription management and decentralized finance, allowing users to earn yields while maintaining regular payments with minimal effort.
