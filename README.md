# VaultPay
VaultPay is a decentralized subscription platform built on the Solana blockchain. It allows users to set up auto-compounding vaults where they can deposit stablecoins likePYUSD, earn high yields, and pay for subscriptions seamlessly. Built with Solana's Anchor framework, VaultPay ensures optimized yield management and automated subscription payments for both users and vendors.

# Features
- Auto-Compounding Vaults: Deposit stablecoins and earn yields through automatic compounding on yield platforms like Kamino.
- Subscription Payments: Users can subscribe to vendors, and payments are automatically withdrawn from the vaults when due, while continuing to compound.
- Vendor Whitelisting: Vendors are registered and whitelisted to ensure legitimate subscription services.
- Seamless DeFi Integration: Optimizes yield generation with the high performance and low costs of Solana's DeFi ecosystem.

# Architecture
- Frontend: A user-friendly interface for setting up vaults, managing subscriptions, and viewing yields.
- Backend: Handles interactions between the frontend, smart contracts, and vendor validation.
- Smart Contracts (Anchor): Written in Rust, handles the core logic for vaults, subscriptions, and payments.

# Getting Started
## Prerequisites
Node.js (for frontend and backend development)
Anchor (for Solana smart contracts)
Solana CLI (for managing Solana network interactions)
Rust (for writing Anchor smart contracts)

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vaultpay.git
cd vaultpay
```

Install dependencies for the frontend:
```
cd frontend
npm install
```
Install dependencies for the backend:

```
cd ../backend
npm install
```

Install dependencies for the Anchor smart contracts:
```
cd ../anchor
anchor build
```
## Running the Project
### Frontend:

Start the frontend development server:
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
### Backend:

Start the backend server:
```
cd backend
npm run dev
```
### Smart Contracts:

Deploy the smart contracts locally for testing:
```
cd anchor
anchor deploy
```
### Scripts:

You can run automated deployment scripts or tests with the scripts in the */scripts/ folder.

## Testing
Run tests for smart contracts:
```
cd anchor
anchor test
```
Run frontend/backend tests as required using standard testing libraries (e.g., jest for frontend).

## Deployment
Refer to the deploy.sh script in the scripts/ folder for a guide on deploying VaultPay to the Solana mainnet or a devnet.
